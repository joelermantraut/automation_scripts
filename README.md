# automation_scripts
Collection of scripts used to simplify automation tasks.

It includes:

 - Use of the module PyAutoGUI, really powerful for automation.
 - Use of files, with common functions.
 - Encription of strings, less common but sometimes needed.
 - Use of JSON files, with some exceptions included.
 - Mouse and keyboard control and monitoring.
 - OS functions, like get OS info or screen info.
 - Read of PDF files.
 - Simplify use of regular expressions functions, without need
   to decide if use match, search of findall.
 - Web parsing to get information of web pages.
 - Web scrapping with chrome driver.
 - Multiprocessing management.
 - Advance printing functions.

## Usage

The idea is to include this files like python modules and 
use them without needing to pay attention to exceptions or
whims of each module.
 
## Important

This scripts are in development staged. They had been tested, but can have errors
or fail eventually. Take care on it use.

## Documentation

To see documentation, import each module, and in python interpreter run:

´´´
help(module)
´´´

Each module has a little example function in main, probably used to test
it.
